Sublime Text 3 -- Materialize theme, has been forked, today on 26Oct17.

I installed this theme in ST3, today.

Materialize - Packages - Package Control
https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Materialize


To activate this 'Materialize' theme, either Add, these 2 lines:
		"color_scheme": "Packages/Materialize/schemes/Material Toy Chest.tmTheme",
    	"theme": "Material Brogrammer.sublime-theme"
    OR
    Tools-->'Command Pallette' OR (Ctrl+Shift+P) & then type 'Activate', 
    			you will see, the command 'Activate Materialize theme'.

    Then, there are some customizations, that make the Materialize--theme look
    a little--or--more better. Some are almost essential--type--of.
    So, these need to be Added to ST3 user--preferences file, manually, as json entries.
    I have made a copy of this 'user--preferences' file as:
    'Preferences.sublime-settings -- backup_copy1__26Oct17--just after Materialize was set'
    Just, copy--Rename this file, after 'Materialize' theme is installed.
    It will set the  'Materialize--theme', with essential json options.
